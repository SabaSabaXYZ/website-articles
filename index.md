# Saba's Site

Welcome to my website!
I am a software developer with an interest in functional programming, Git, and other things.

This website was built from scratch to support custom theming.
Please scroll down to the bottom of the page to set a background colour and a light/dark view mode.

The _Style_ field offers two options: _Dark_ and _Light_.
_Dark_ signifies the use of a dark background, so the text is lightened to accommodate it.
Conversely, _Light_ signifies the use of a light background, resulting in darkened text.

The _Red_, _Green_, and _Blue_ fields are limited to integers between 0 and 255.
A higher value introduces more of that colour into the background.
Thus, `(0, 0, 0)` results in a black background, while `(255, 255, 255)` results in a white background.

After setting your preferred colour settings, visit a link to have your theme encoded in the URL.
